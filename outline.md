## Deadline: April 26th, 2023 by 9am

## Names: Andrew Briercheck, Miles Franck, and Nic Ingerson

## Topic(s) We Chose

- How students view AI-based systems.
- How students utilize AI-based systems.
- Ideas for integrating AI into teaching.

## Introduction

- Artificial Intelligence has been a hot topic as of late (ex. ChatGPT, AI Art, and voice synthesis)
- AI has a negative effect on education
  - Scary and foreign
    - Older generation -- don't understand it
    - Newer generation -- see it as some sort of magical thing; also don't understand it
  - ChatGPT leads to cheating and plagiarism

## Deeper Look

- How students view AI-based systems
  - [51% of college students believe using AI is considered cheating, 1 in 5 of that 51% use it anyways](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-students-ai-tools-survey/#:~:text=Half%20of%20College%20Students%20Say%20Using%20AI%20on%20Schoolwork%20Is,in%205%20use%20them%20anyway)
- How students utilize AI-based systems
  - Typically to cheat – using ChatGPT to generate essays and code
  - Some use it to come up with ideas for events, etc.
- If they know it’s cheating, then why are they using it?
  - [AI can make plagiarism harder to detect](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/19/ai-makes-plagiarism-harder-to-detect-argue-academics-in-paper-written-by-chatbot)
  - Ease of access
    - It’s free and you can access from your browser; it’s very convenient to use
  - Human nature
    - If there is an easier way to get a task done, people will take it
  - Integration:
    - It has become a deeper part of our day to day
      - Ex: Spotify, Quizlet, Microsoft Office Suite, etc.
    - Developing methodologies to use in healthy moderation/keep it in check
    - Development of methodologies to utilize as a way to keep it in check.

## Call to Action/Suggestions

- Regulation on AI
  - In Allegheny’s case, updating the honor code system
- Using AI to detect AI
  - Using the tools used to create ChatGPT, someone could make something that detects AI writing
    - AI generated text lacks a sort of bombasity in natural human writing
- Education
  - A deeper understanding into how these algorithms work can give better insight and understanding into how to develop a healthier relationship with these programs.

## Conclusion

- Overall, while the rapid development of artificial intelligence is impressive, its effects on education cannot be understated.
  - People use AI in a multitude of ways; most of which have to do with cheating/plagiarism
  - Doesn’t have to be this way
    - Regulating, detecting, and educating ourselves on AI can help prevent abuse and intense distrust of these programs in the future
